	abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a non-negligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.},

	abstract = {Numerous statistical machine learning methods suitable for application to highly correlated features, as those that exist for spectral data, could potentially improve prediction performance over the commonly used partial least squares approach. Milk samples from 622 individual cows with known detailed protein composition and technological trait data accompanied by mid-infrared spectra were available to assess the predictive ability of different regression and classification algorithms. The regression-based approaches were partial least squares regression (PLSR), ridge regression (RR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), elastic net, principal component regression, projection pursuit regression, spike and slab regression, random forests, boosting decision trees, neural networks (NN), and a post-hoc approach of model averaging (MA). Several classification methods (i.e., partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), random forests, boosting decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM)) were also used after stratifying the traits of interest into categories. In the regression analyses, MA was the best prediction method for 6 of the 14 traits investigated [curd firmness at 60 min, αS1-casein (CN), αS2-CN, κ-CN, α-lactalbumin, and β-lactoglobulin B], whereas NN and RR were the best algorithms for 3 traits each (rennet coagulation time, curd-firming time, and heat stability, and curd firmness at 30 min, β-CN, and β-lactoglobulin A, respectively), PLSR was best for pH, and LASSO was best for CN micelle size. When traits were divided into 2 classes, SVM had the greatest accuracy for the majority of the traits investigated. Although the well-established PLSR-based method performed competitively, the application of statistical machine learning methods for regression analyses reduced the root mean square error compared with PLSR from between 0.18\% (κ-CN) to 3.67\% (heat stability). The use of modern statistical machine learning methods for trait prediction from mid-infrared spectroscopy may improve the prediction accuracy for some traits.},

	abstract = {Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) at both the individual cow and the herd level has become a key target in dairy production systems, for both environmental and economic reasons. Cost-effective and large-scale phenotyping methods are required to improve NUE through genetic selection and by feeding and management strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using mid-infrared (MIR) spectra of milk to predict individual dairy cow NUE during early lactation. Data were collected from 129 Holstein cows, from calving until 50 d in milk, in 3 research herds (Denmark, Ireland, and the UK). In 2 of the herds, diets were designed to challenge cows metabolically, whereas a diet reflecting local management practices was offered in the third herd. Nitrogen intake (kg/d) and nitrogen excreted in milk (kg/d) were calculated daily. Nitrogen use efficiency was calculated as the ratio between nitrogen in milk and nitrogen intake, and expressed as a percentage. Individual daily values for NUE ranged from 9.7 to 81.7\%, with an average of 36.9\% and standard deviation of 10.4\%. Milk MIR spectra were recorded twice weekly and were standardized into a common format to avoid bias between apparatus or sampling periods. Regression models predicting NUE using milk MIR spectra were developed on 1,034 observations using partial least squares or support vector machines regression methods. The models were then evaluated through (1) a cross-validation using 10 subsets, (2) a cow validation excluding 25\% of the cows to be used as a validation set, and (3) a diet validation excluding each of the diets one by one to be used as validation sets. The best statistical performances were obtained when using the support vector machines method. Inclusion of milk yield and lactation number as predictors, in combination with the spectra, also improved the calibration. In cross-validation, the best model predicted NUE with a coefficient of determination of cross-validation of 0.74 and a relative error of 14\%, which is suitable to discriminate between low- and high-NUE cows. When performing the cow validation, the relative error remained at 14\%, and during the diet validation the relative error ranged from 12 to 34\%. In the diet validation, the models showed a lack of robustness, demonstrating difficulties in predicting NUE for diets and for samples that were not represented in the calibration data set. Hence, a need exists to integrate more data in the models to cover a maximum of variability regarding breeds, diets, lactation stages, management practices, seasons, MIR instruments, and geographic regions. Although the model needs to be validated and improved for use in routine conditions, these preliminary results showed that it was possible to obtain information on NUE through milk MIR spectra. This could potentially allow large-scale predictions to aid both further genetic and genomic studies, and the development of farm management tools.},

We hypothesized that milk pH testing provides an accurate, low-cost, and practical on-farm method for diagnosing SCM and IMI. The main objective was to evaluate the clinical utility of measuring milk pH using 3 tests of increasing pH resolution: Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips for Urinalysis (Multistix strips, Bayer HealthCare Inc., Elkhart, IN), pH Hydrion paper (Microessential Laboratory, Brooklyn, NY), and Piccolo plus pH meter (Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI), for diagnosing SCM and IMI in dairy cattle. Quarter foremilk samples were collected from 115 dairy cows at dry off and 92 fresh cows within 4 to 7 d postcalving. Quarter somatic cell count (SCC) was measured using a DeLaval cell counter (DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden), with SCM defined as SCC {\textgreater}200,000 cells/mL and IMI defined as SCC {\textgreater}100,000 cells/mL and the presence of microorganisms at ≥10 cfu/mL of milk. Milk pH was measured at 37°C using the 3 test methods. The Hydrion pH paper performed poorly in diagnosing SCM and IMI. Receiver operating curve analysis provided optimal pH cutpoints for diagnosing SCM for the pH meter (dry off, ≥6.67; freshening, ≥6.52) and Multistix strips (dry off and freshening, ≥7.0). Test performance of the pH meter and Multistix strips was poor to fair based on area under the receiver operating curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and kappa coefficient. The pH meter and Multistix strips performed poorly in diagnosing IMI at dry off and freshening. We concluded that milk pH does not provide a clinically useful method for diagnosing SCM or IMI in dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {A dairy cow's lifetime resilience and her ability to recalve gain importance on dairy farms, as they affect all aspects of the sustainability of the dairy industry. Many modern farms today have milk meters and activity sensors that accurately measure yield and activity at a high frequency for monitoring purposes. We hypothesized that these same sensors can be used for precision phenotyping of complex traits such as lifetime resilience or productive life span. The objective of this study was to investigate whether lifetime resilience and productive life span of dairy cows can be predicted using sensor-derived proxies of first-parity sensor data. We used a data set from 27 Belgian and British dairy farms with an automated milking system containing at least 5 yr of successive measurements. All of these farms had milk meter data available, and 13 of these farms were also equipped with activity sensors. This subset was used to investigate the added value of activity meters to improve the model's prediction accuracy. To rank cows for lifetime resilience, a score was attributed to each cow based on her number of calvings, her 305-d milk yield, her age at first calving, her calving intervals, and the DIM at the moment of culling, taking her entire lifetime into account. Next, this lifetime resilience score was used to rank the cows within their herd, resulting in a lifetime resilience ranking. Based on this ranking, cows were classified in a low (last third), moderate (middle third), or high (first third) resilience category within farm. In total, 45 biologically sound sensor features were defined from the time series data, including measures of variability, lactation curve shape, milk yield perturbations, activity spikes indicating estrous events, and activity dynamics representing health events (e.g., drops in daily activity). These features, calculated on first-lactation data, were used to predict the lifetime resilience rank and, thus, to predict the classification within the herd (low, moderate, or high). Using a specific linear regression model progressively including features stepwise selected at farm level (cutoff P-value of 0.2), classification performances were between 35.9 and 70.0\% (46.7 ± 8.0, mean ± SD) for milk yield features only, and between 46.7 and 84.0\% (55.5 ± 12.1, mean ± SD) for lactation and activity features together. This is, respectively, 13.7 and 22.2\% higher than what random classification would give. Moreover, using these individual farm models, only 3.5 and 2.3\% of cows were classified high when they were actually low, or vice versa, whereas respectively 91.8 and 94.1\% of wrongly classified animals were predicted in an adjacent category. The sensor features retained in the prediction equation of the individual farms differed across farms, which demonstrates the variability in culling and management strategies across farms and within farms over time. This lack of a common model structure across farms suggests the need to consider local (and evidence-based) culling management rules when developing decision support tools for dairy farms. With this study we showed the potential of precision phenotyping of complex traits based on biologically meaningful features derived from readily available sensor data. We conclude that first-lactation milk and activity sensor data have the potential to predict cows' lifetime resilience rankings within farms but that consistency between farms is currently lacking.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to quantify the error of body weight prediction using automatically measured morphological traits in a 3-dimensional (3D) vision system and to assess the influence of various sources of uncertainty on body weight prediction. In this case study, an image acquisition setup was created in a cow selection box equipped with a top-view 3-D camera. Morphological traits of hip height, hip width, and rump length were automatically extracted from the raw 3-D images taken of the rump area of dairy cows (n = 30). These traits combined with days in milk, age, and parity were used in multiple linear regression models to predict body weight. To find the best prediction model, an exhaustive feature selection algorithm was used to build intermediate models (n = 63). Each model was validated by leave-one-out crossvalidation, giving the root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error. The model consisting of hip width (measurement variability of 0.006 m), days in milk, and parity was the best model, with the lowest errors of 41.2 kg of root mean square error and 5.2\% mean absolute percentage error. Our integrated system, including the image acquisition setup, image analysis, and the best prediction model, predicted the body weights with a performance similar to that achieved using semi-automated or manual methods. Moreover, the variability of our simplified morphological trait measurement showed a negligible contribution to the uncertainty of body weight prediction. We suggest that dairy cow body weight prediction can be improved by incorporating more predictive morphological traits and by improving the prediction model structure.},

Although many well-documented indicators can detect the imminence of calving, research is limited on their effectiveness to predict calving when measured by automated devices. The objective of this experiment was to determine if a decrease in vaginal temperature (VT), rumination (RT), and lying time (LT), or an increase in lying bouts (LB), as measured by 3 automated devices, could accurately predict the onset of calving within 24, 12, and 6h. The combination of these 4 calving indicators was also evaluated. Forty-two multiparous Holstein cows housed in tie-stalls were fitted with a temperature logger inserted in the vaginal cavity 7±2d before their expected calving date; VT was recorded at 1-min intervals. An ear-attached sensor recorded rumination time every hour based on ear movement while an accelerometer fitted to the right hind leg recorded cow position at 1-min intervals. On average, VT were 0.3±0.03°C lower, and RT and LT were 41±17 and 52±28min lower, respectively, on the calving day compared with the previous 4d. Cows had 2±1 more LB on the calving day. Of the 4 indicators, a decrease in VT≥0.1°C was best able to predict calving within the next 24h with a sensitivity of 74\%, specificity of 74\%, positive and negative predictive values of 51 and 89\%, and area under the curve of 0.80. Combining the indicators enhanced the performance to predict calving within the next 24, 12, and 6h with best overall results obtained by combining the 3 devices for prediction within the next 24h (sensitivity: 77\%, specificity: 77\%, positive and negative predictive values: 56 and 90\%, area under the curve: 0.82). These results indicate that a device that could simultaneously measure these 4 calving indicators could not precisely determine the onset of calving, but the information collected would assist dairy farmers in monitoring the onset of calving.},

	abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a zoonotic disease in cattle that is transmissible to humans, distributed worldwide, and considered endemic throughout much of England and Wales. Mid-infrared (MIR) analysis of milk is used routinely to predict fat and protein concentration, and is also a robust predictor of several other economically important traits including individual fatty acids and body energy. This study predicted bTB status of UK dairy cows using their MIR spectral profiles collected as part of routine milk recording. Bovine tuberculosis data were collected as part of the national bTB testing program for Scotland, England, and Wales; these data provided information from over 40,500 bTB herd breakdowns. Corresponding individual cow life–history data were also available and provided information on births, movements, and deaths of all cows in the study. Data relating to single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) skin-test results, culture, slaughter status, and presence of lesions were combined to create a binary bTB phenotype labeled 0 to represent nonresponders (i.e., healthy cows) and 1 to represent responders (i.e., bTB-affected cows). Contemporaneous individual milk MIR spectral data were collected as part of monthly routine milk recording and matched to bTB status of individual animals on the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin test date (±15 d). Deep learning, a sub-branch of machine learning, was used to train artificial neural networks and develop a prediction pipeline for subsequent use in national herds as part of routine milk recording. Spectra were first converted to 53 × 20-pixel PNG images, then used to train a deep convolutional neural network. Deep convolutional neural networks resulted in a bTB prediction accuracy (i.e., the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions) of 71\% after training for 278 epochs. This was accompanied by both a low validation loss (0.71) and moderate sensitivity and specificity (0.79 and 0.65, respectively). To balance data in each class, additional training data were synthesized using the synthetic minority over sampling technique. Accuracy was further increased to 95\% (after 295 epochs), with corresponding validation loss minimized (0.26), when synthesized data were included during training of the network. Sensitivity and specificity also saw a 1.22- and 1.45-fold increase to 0.96 and 0.94, respectively, when synthesized data were included during training. We believe this study to be the first of its kind to predict bTB status from milk MIR spectral data. We also believe it to be the first study to use milk MIR spectral data to predict a disease phenotype, and posit that the automated prediction of bTB status at routine milk recording could provide farmers with a robust tool that enables them to make early management decisions on potential reactor cows, and thus help slow the spread of bTB.},

	abstract = {Rapid detection of dairy cow mastitis is important so corrective action can be taken as soon as possible. Automatically collected sensor data used to monitor the performance and the health state of the cow could be useful for rapid detection of mastitis while reducing the labor needs for monitoring. The state of the art in combining sensor data to predict clinical mastitis still does not perform well enough to be applied in practice. Our objective was to combine a multivariate dynamic linear model (DLM) with a naïve Bayesian classifier (NBC) in a novel method using sensor and nonsensor data to detect clinical cases of mastitis. We also evaluated reductions in the number of sensors for detecting mastitis. With the DLM, we co-modeled 7 sources of sensor data (milk yield, fat, protein, lactose, conductivity, blood, body weight) collected at each milking for individual cows to produce one-step-ahead forecasts for each sensor. The observations were subsequently categorized according to the errors of the forecasted values and the estimated forecast variance. The categorized sensor data were combined with other data pertaining to the cow (week in milk, parity, mastitis history, somatic cell count category, and season) using Bayes’ theorem, which produced a combined probability of the cow having clinical mastitis. If this probability was above a set threshold, the cow was classified as mastitis positive. To illustrate the performance of our method, we used sensor data from 1,003,207 milkings from the University of Florida Dairy Unit collected from 2008 to 2014. Of these, 2,907 milkings were associated with recorded cases of clinical mastitis. Using the DLM/NBC method, we reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, with a specificity of 0.81 when the sensitivity was set at 0.80. Specificities with omissions of sensor data ranged from 0.58 to 0.81. These results are comparable to other studies, but differences in data quality, definitions of clinical mastitis, and time windows make comparisons across studies difficult. We found the DLM/NBC method to be a flexible method for combining multiple sensor and nonsensor data sources to predict clinical mastitis and accommodate missing observations. Further research is needed before practical implementation is possible. In particular, the performance of our method needs to be improved in the first 2 wk of lactation. The DLM method produces forecasts that are based on continuously estimated multivariate normal distributions, which makes forecasts and forecast errors easy to interpret, and new sensors can easily be added.},

	abstract = {Feed intake is one of the most important components of feed efficiency in dairy systems. However, it is a difficult trait to measure in commercial operations for individual cows. Milk spectrum from mid-infrared spectroscopy has been previously used to predict milk traits, and could be an alternative to predict dry matter intake (DMI). The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate if milk spectra can improve DMI predictions based only on cow variables; (2) to compare artificial neural network (ANN) and partial least squares (PLS) predictions; and (3) to evaluate if wavelength (WL) selection through Bayesian network (BN) improves prediction quality. Milk samples (n = 1,279) from 308 mid-lactation dairy cows [127 ± 27 d in milk (DIM)] were collected between 2014 and 2016. For each milk spectra time point, DMI (kg/d), body weight (BW, kg), milk yield (MY, kg/d), fat (\%), protein (\%), lactose (\%), and actual DIM were recorded. The DMI was predicted with ANN and PLS using different combinations of explanatory variables. Such combinations, called covariate sets, were as follows: set 1 (MY, BW0.75, DIM, and 361 WL); set 2 [MY, BW0.75, DIM, and 33 WL (WL selected by BN)]; set 3 (MY, BW0.75, DIM, and fat, protein, and lactose concentrations); set 4 (MY, BW0.75, DIM, 33 WL, fat, protein, and lactose); set 5 (MY, BW0.75, DIM, 33 WL, and visit duration in the feed bunk); set 6 (MY, DIM, and 33 WL); set 7 (MY, BW0.75, and DIM); set-WL (included 361 WL); and set-BN (included just 33 selected WL). All models (i.e., each combination of covariate set and fitting approach, ANN or PLS) were validated with an external data set. The use of ANN improved the performance of models 2, 5, 6, and BN. The use of BN combined with ANN yielded the highest accuracy and precision. The addition of individual WL compared with milk components (set 2 vs. set 3) did not improve prediction quality when using PLS. However, when ANN was employed, the model prediction with the inclusion of 33 WL was improved over the model containing only milk components (set 2 vs. set 3; concordance correlation coefficient = 0.80 vs. 0.72; coefficient of determination = 0.67 vs. 0.53; root mean square error of prediction 2.36 vs. 2.81 kg/d). The use of ANN and the inclusion of a behavior parameter, set 5, resulted in the best predictions compared with all other models (coefficient of determination = 0.70, concordance correlation coefficient = 0.83, root mean square error of prediction = 2.15 kg/d). The addition of milk spectra information to models containing cow variables improved the accuracy and precision of DMI predictions in lactating dairy cows when ANN was used. The use of BN to select more informative WL improved the model prediction when combined with cow variables, with further improvement when combined with ANN.},

	abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) represents one of the major disease challenges affecting preweaning dairy-bred calves. Previous studies have shown that differences in feeding and activity behaviors exist between healthy and diseased calves affected by BRD. The aim of this study was to develop and assess the accuracy of models designed to predict BRD from feeding and activity behaviors. Feeding and activity behaviors were recorded for 100 male preweaning calves between {\textasciitilde}8 to 42 d of age. Calves were group housed with ad libitum access to milk via automatic milk feeders, water, starter diet, and straw. Activity was monitored via a leg-mounted accelerometer. Health status of individual calves was monitored daily using an adapted version of the Wisconsin Scoring System to identify BRD. Three models were created to predict disease: (1) deviation from normal lying time based on moving averages (MA); (2) random forest (RF), a machine learning technique based on feeding and activity variables; and (3) a combination of RF and MA output. For the MA model, lying time was predicted based on behavior over previous days (3- and 7-d MA) and the expected value for the current day (based on calf age; measured using accelerometers). Data were not split into training and test data sets. Occasions when the actual lying time increased {\textgreater}9\% of predicted lying time were classified as a deviation from normal and a disease alert was provided. Both feeding and activity behaviors were included within the RF model. Data were split into training (70\%) and test (30\%) data sets based on disease events. Events were classified as 2 d before, the day(s) of the disease event, and 2 d after the event. Accuracy of models was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). If a positive disease prediction agreed with an actual disease event within a 3-d rolling window, it was classified as a true positive. Stand-alone models (RF; MA) showed high specificity (0.95; 0.97), moderate sensitivity (0.35; 0.43), balanced accuracy (0.65; 0.64), and MCC (0.25; 0.29). Combining outputs increased accuracy (specificity = 0.95, sensitivity = 0.54, balanced accuracy = 0.75, MCC = 0.36). The work presented is the first to demonstrate the use of modeling data derived from precision livestock farming techniques that monitor feeding and activity behaviors for early detection of BRD in preweaning calves, offering a significant advance in health management of youngstock.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models that predict water intake by drinking, also known as free water intake (FWI), are useful in understanding water supply needed by animals on dairy farms. The majority of extant mathematical models for predicting FWI of dairy cows have been developed with data sets representing similar experimental conditions, not evaluated with modern cows, and often require dry matter intake (DMI) data, which may not be routinely available. The objectives of the study were to (1) develop a set of new empirical models for predicting FWI of lactating and dry cows with and without DMI using literature data, and (2) evaluate the new and the extant models using an independent set of FWI measurements made on modern cows. Random effect meta-regression analyses were conducted using 72 and 188 FWI treatment means with and without dietary electrolyte and daily mean ambient temperature (TMP) records, respectively, for lactating cows, and 19 FWI treatment means for dry cows. Milk yield, DMI, body weight, days in milk, dietary macro-nutrient contents, an aggregate milliequivalent concentration of dietary sodium and potassium (NaK), and TMP were used as potential covariates to the models. A model having positive relationships of DMI, dietary dry matter (DM\%), and CP (CP\%) contents, NaK, and TMP explained 76\% of variability in FWI treatment means of lactating cows. When challenged on an independent data set (n=261), the model more accurately predicted FWI [root mean square prediction error as a percentage of average observed value (RMSPE\%)=14.4\%] compared with a model developed without NaK and TMP (RMSPE\%=17.3\%), and all extant models (RMSPE\%≥15.7\%). A model without DMI included positive relationships of milk yield, DM\%, NaK, TMP, and days in milk, and explained 63\% of variability in the FWI treatment means and performed well (RMSPE\%=17.9\%), when challenged on the independent data. New models for dry cows included positive relationships of DM\% and TMP along with DMI or body weight. The new models with and without DMI explained 75 and 54\% of the variability in FWI treatment means of dry cows and had RMSPE\% of 12.8 and 15.2\%, respectively, when evaluated with the literature data. The study offers a set of empirical models that can assist in determining drinking water needs of dairy farms.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to determine the effects of dry matter intake (DMI), body weight (BW), and diet characteristics on total tract digestibilities of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, and starch (DMD, NDFD, and StarchD, respectively) in high-producing dairy cows. Our database was composed of 1,942 observations from 662 cows in 54 studies from Michigan, Ohio, and Georgia. On average, cows ate 23 ± 4.5 kg of dry matter/d, weighed 669 ± 79 kg, and produced 38 ± 10 kg of milk/d. Diets were 31 ± 5\% neutral detergent fiber, 27 ± 6\% starch, 2.6 ± 1.2\% fatty acids, and 17 ± 1.4\% crude protein. Digestibility means were 66 ± 6, 42 ± 11, and 93 ± 5\% for DMD, NDFD, and StarchD, respectively. Forage sources included corn silage, alfalfa, and grasses. Corn source was classified by its ruminal fermentability. Data were analyzed using a mixed effects model, including diet chemical composition, forage source, and corn source, all expressed as percentage of dry matter, except for DMI, which was expressed as percentage of BW (DMI\%BW); location and 2-way interactions were fixed effects. Cow, block, period, treatment, and study were included as random effects. Best fitting candidate models were generated using backward and stepwise regression methods. Additionally, the simplest model was generated using only DMI and location as fixed effects and all random effects. Candidate models were cross-validated across studies, and the resulting predictive correlation coefficients across studies (PC) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) were compared by t-test. For each nutrient, the digestibility model that resulted in the highest PC and lowest RMSEP was determined to be the best fitting model. We observed heterogeneous coefficients among the different locations, suggesting that specific location factors influenced digestibilities. The overall location-averaged best fitting prediction equations were: DMD = 69 − 0.83 × DMI\%BW (PC = 0.22, RMSEP = 5.39); NDFD = 53 + 0.26 × grass \%DM − 0.59 × starch \%DM + 3.06 × DMI\%BW − 0.46 × DMI\%BW2 (PC = 0.53, RMSEP = 9.70); and StarchD = 96 + 0.19 × HFERM\%DM − 0.12 × starch \%DM − 1.13 × DMI\%BW (PC = 0.34, RMSEP = 4.77); where HFERM\%DM is highly-fermentable corn source as percentage of DM. Our results confirm that digestibility is reduced as DMI increases, albeit at a lower rate than that reported in National Research Council. Furthermore, dietary starch depresses NDFD. Whereas DMD can be predicted based on DMI only, the best predictions for NDFD and StarchD require diet characteristics in addition to DMI.},

	abstract = {The objectives of the study were to use a heat stress scoring system to evaluate the severity of heat stress on dairy cows using different heat abatement techniques. The scoring system ranged from 1 to 4, where 1 = no heat stress; 2 = mild heat stress; 3 = severe heat stress; and 4 = moribund. The accuracy of the scoring system was then predicted using 3 machine learning techniques: logistic regression, Gaussian naïve Bayes, and random forest. To predict the accuracy of the scoring system, these techniques used factors including temperature-humidity index, respiration rate, lying time, lying bouts, total steps, drooling, open-mouth breathing, panting, location in shade or sprinklers, somatic cell score, reticulorumen temperature, hygiene body condition score, milk yield, and milk fat and protein percent. Three different treatments, namely, portable shade structure, portable polyvinyl chloride pipe sprinkler system, or control with no heat abatement, were considered, where each treatment was replicated 3 times with 3 second-trimester lactating cows. Results indicate that random forest outperformed the other 2 methods, with respect to both accuracy and precision, in predicting the sprinkler group's score. Both logistic regression and random forest were consistent in predicting scores for control, shade, and combined groups. The mean probability of predicting non-heat-stressed cows was highest for cows in the sprinkler group. Finally, the logistic regression method worked best for predicting heat-stressed cows in control, shade, and combined. The insights gained from these results could aid dairy producers to detect heat stress before it becomes severe, which could decrease the negative effects of heat stress, such as milk loss.},

However, this approach requires a rapid and inexpensive measurement technique that can be used to quantify CH4 emission for a large number of individual dairy cows. Milk infrared (IR) spectroscopy has been proposed as a predictor for CH4 emission. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of milk IR spectra to predict breath sensor–measured CH4 of 801 dairy cows on 10 commercial farms. To evaluate the prediction equation, we used random and block cross validation. Using random cross validation, we found a validation coefficient of determination (R2val) of 0.49, which suggests that milk IR spectra are informative in predicting CH4 emission. However, based on block cross validation, with farms as blocks, a negligible R2val of 0.01 was obtained, indicating that milk IR spectra cannot be used to predict CH4 emission. Random cross validation thus results in an overoptimistic view of the ability of milk IR spectra to predict CH4 emission of dairy cows. The difference between the validation strategies could be due to the confounding of farm and date of milk IR analysis, which introduces a correlation between batch effects on the IR analyses and farm-average CH4. Breath sensor–measured CH4 is strongly influenced by farm-specific conditions, which magnifies the problem. Milk IR wavenumbers from water absorption regions, which are generally considered uninformative, showed moderate accuracy (R2val = 0.25) when based on random cross validation, but not when based on block cross validation (R2val = 0.03). These results indicate, therefore, that in the current study, random cross validation results in an overoptimistic view on the ability of milk IR spectra to predict CH4 emission. We suggest prediction based on wavenumbers from water absorption regions as a negative control to identify potential dependence structures in the data.},

	abstract = {Binary classification is a common task for which machine learning and computational statistics are used, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) has become the common standard metric to evaluate binary classifications in most scientific fields. The ROC curve has true positive rate (also called sensitivity or recall) on the y axis and false positive rate on the x axis, and the ROC AUC can range from 0 (worst result) to 1 (perfect result). The ROC AUC, however, has several flaws and drawbacks. This score is generated including predictions that obtained insufficient sensitivity and specificity, and moreover it does not say anything about positive predictive value (also known as precision) nor negative predictive value (NPV) obtained by the classifier, therefore potentially generating inflated overoptimistic results. Since it is common to include ROC AUC alone without precision and negative predictive value, a researcher might erroneously conclude that their classification was successful. Furthermore, a given point in the ROC space does not identify a single confusion matrix nor a group of matrices sharing the same MCC value. Indeed, a given (sensitivity, specificity) pair can cover a broad MCC range, which casts doubts on the reliability of ROC AUC as a performance measure. In contrast, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) generates a high score in its \$\$[-1; +1]\$\$interval only if the classifier scored a high value for all the four basic rates of the confusion matrix: sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value. A high MCC (for example, MCC \$\$=\$\$0.9), moreover, always corresponds to a high ROC AUC, and not vice versa. In this short study, we explain why the Matthews correlation coefficient should replace the ROC AUC as standard statistic in all the scientific studies involving a binary classification, in all scientific fields.},

	abstract = {Cheese-making traits in dairy cattle are important to the dairy industry but are difficult to measure at the individual level because there are limitations on collecting phenotypic information. Mid-infrared spectroscopy has its advantages, but it can only be used during monthly milk recordings. Recently, in-line devices for real-time analysis of milk quality have been developed. The AfiLab recording system (Afimilk) offers significant benefits as phenotypes can be collected from each cow at each milking session. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of integrating AfiLab real-time milk analyzer measures with the stacking ensemble learning technique using heterogeneous base learners for the in-line daily monitoring of cheese-making traits in Holstein cattle with a view to developing a precision livestock farming system for monitoring the technological quality of milk. Data and samples for wet-laboratory analyses were collected from 499 Holstein cows belonging to 2 farms where the AfiLab system was installed. The traits of concern were 9 milk coagulation traits [3 milk coagulation properties (MCP), and 6 curd firming traits (CFt)], and 7 cheese-making traits [3 cheese yield (CY) traits, and 4 milk nutrient recovery in the curd (REC) traits]. The near-infrared AfiLab spectral data and on-farm information (days in milk and parity) were used to assess the predictive ability of different statistical methods [elastic net (EN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural network (ANN)] across different cross-validation scenarios. These statistical methods were considered the base learners, which were then combined in a stacking ensemble learning. Results indicate that including information on the cows (days in milk and parity) in the AfiLab infrared prediction increased its accuracy by 10.3\% for traditional MCP, 13.8\% for curd firming, 9.8\% for CY, and 11.2\% for REC traits compared with those obtained from near-infrared AfiLab alone. The statistical approaches exhibited high prediction accuracies (R2) averaged across the cross-validation scenarios for traditional MCP (0.58 for ANN, 0.55 for EN and GBM, 0.52 for XGBoost, and 0.62 for stacking ensemble), CFt (0.55 for ANN, 0.54 for EN and GBM, 0.53 for XGBoost, and 0.61 for stacking ensemble), and similar R2 averages for CY and REC (0.55 for ANN, 0.54 for EN and GBM, 0.53 for XGBoost, and 0.61 for stacking ensemble). The ANN approach was more accurate than the other base learners (EN, GBM, and XGBoost) and improved accuracy across cross-validation scenarios on average by 7\% for traditional MCP, 5\% for CFt, 8\% for CY, and 7\% for REC. The stacking ensemble method improved prediction accuracy by 3\% to 31\% for traditional MCP, 2\% to 26\% for CFt, 1\% to 38\% for CY traits, and 2\% to 27\% for REC traits compared with the base learners. The prediction accuracies of the different approaches evaluated tended to decrease from the 10-fold cross-validation to the independent validation scenario, although there was a smaller reduction in prediction accuracy with the stacking ensemble learning technique across all the cross-validation scenarios. Our results show that combining in-line on-farm information with stacking ensemble machine learning represents an effective alternative for obtaining robust daily predictions of milk cheese-making traits.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) imaging offers new possibilities in animal phenotyping. Here, we investigated how this technology can be used to study the morphological changes that occur in dairy cows over the course of a single lactation. First, we estimated the individual body weight (BW) of dairy cows using traits measured with 3D images. To improve the quality of prediction, we monitored body growth (via 3D imaging), gut fill (via individual dry matter intake), and body reserves (via body condition score) throughout lactation. A group of 16 Holstein cows—8 in their first lactation, 4 in their second lactation, and 4 in their third or higher lactation—was scanned in 3D once a month for an entire lactation. Values of morphological traits (e.g., chest depth or hip width) increased continuously with parity, but cows in their first lactation experienced the largest increase during the monitoring period. Values of partial volume, estimated from point of shoulder to pin bone, predicted BW with an error of 25.4 kg (R2 = 0.92), which was reduced to 14.3 kg when the individual effect of cows was added to the estimation model. The model was further improved by the addition of partial surface area (from point of shoulder to pin bone), hip width, chest depth, diagonal length, and heart girth, which increased the R2 of BW prediction to 0.94 and decreased root mean square error to 22.1 kg. The different slopes for individual cows were partly explained by body condition score and morphological traits, indicating that they may have reflected differences in body density among animals. Changes in BW over the course of lactation were mostly due to changes in growth, which accounted for around two-thirds of BW gain regardless of parity. Body reserves and gut fill had smaller but still notable effects on body composition, with a higher gain in body reserves and gut fill for cows in their first lactation compared with multiparous cows. This work demonstrated the potential for rapid and low-cost 3D imaging to facilitate the monitoring of several traits of high interest in dairy livestock farming.},

	abstract = {Body condition score (BCS) is a common tool for indirectly estimating the mobilization of energy reserves in the fat and muscle of cattle that meets the requirements of animal welfare and precision livestock farming for the effective monitoring of individual animals. However, previous studies on automatic BCS systems have used manual scoring for data collection, and traditional image extraction methods have limited model performance accuracy. In addition, the radio frequency identification device system commonly used in ranching has the disadvantages of misreadings and damage to bovine bodies. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop and validate an automatic system for identifying individuals and assessing BCS using a deep learning framework. This work developed a linear regression model of BCS using ultrasound backfat thickness to determine BCS for training sets and tested a system based on convolutional neural networks with 3 channels, including depth, gray, and phase congruency, to analyze the back images of 686 cows. After we performed an analysis of image model performance, online verification was used to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the system. The results showed that the selected linear regression model had a high coefficient of determination value (0.976), and the correlation coefficient between manual BCS and ultrasonic BCS was 0.94. Although the overall accuracy of the BCS estimations was high (0.45, 0.77, and 0.98 within 0, 0.25, and 0.5 unit, respectively), the validation for actual BCS ranging from 3.25 to 3.5 was weak (the F1 scores were only 0.6 and 0.57, respectively, within the 0.25-unit range). Overall, individual identification and BCS assessment performed well in the online measurement, with accuracies of 0.937 and 0.409, respectively. A system for individual identification and BCS assessment was developed, and a convolutional neural network using depth, gray, and phase congruency channels to interpret image features exhibited advantages for monitoring thin cows.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the differences in the metabolic profiles in serum of dairy cows that were normal or overconditioned when dried off for elucidating the pathophysiological reasons for the increased health disturbances commonly associated with overconditioning. Fifteen weeks antepartum, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were allocated to either a high body condition (HBCS; n = 19) group or a normal body condition (NBCS; n = 19) group and were fed different diets until dry-off to amplify the difference. The groups were also stratified for comparable milk yields (NBCS: 10,361 ± 302 kg; HBCS: 10,315 ± 437 kg; mean ± standard deviation). At dry-off, the cows in the NBCS group (parity: 2.42 ± 1.84; body weight: 665 ± 64 kg) had a body condition score (BCS) {\textless}3.5 and backfat thickness (BFT) {\textless}1.2 cm, whereas the HBCS cows (parity: 3.37 ± 1.67; body weight: 720 ± 57 kg) had BCS {\textgreater}3.75 and BFT {\textgreater}1.4 cm. During the dry period and the subsequent lactation, both groups were fed identical diets but maintained the BCS and BFT differences. A targeted metabolomics (AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit, Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria) approach was performed in serum samples collected on d −49, +3, +21, and +84 relative to calving for identifying and quantifying up to 188 metabolites from 6 different compound classes (acylcarnitines, AA, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and hexoses). The concentrations of 170 metabolites were above the limit of detection and could thus be used in this study. We used various machine learning (ML) algorithms (e.g., sequential minimal optimization, random forest, alternating decision tree, and naïve Bayes–updatable) to analyze the metabolome data sets. The performance of each algorithm was evaluated by a leave-one-out cross-validation method. The accuracy of classification by the ML algorithms was lowest on d 3 compared with the other time points. Various ML methods (partial least squares discriminant analysis, random forest, information gain ranking) were then performed to identify those metabolites that were contributing most significantly to discriminating the groups. On d 21 after parturition, 12 metabolites (acetylcarnitine, hexadecanoyl-carnitine, hydroxyhexadecenoyl-carnitine, octadecanoyl-carnitine, octadecenoyl-carnitine, hydroxybutyryl-carnitine, glycine, leucine, phosphatidylcholine-diacyl-C40:3, trans-4-hydroxyproline, carnosine, and creatinine) were identified in this way. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that branched-chain AA degradation (before calving) and mitochondrial β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids along with fatty acid metabolism, purine metabolism, and alanine metabolism (after calving) were significantly enriched in HBCS compared with NBCS cows. Our results deepen the insights into the phenotype related to overconditioning from the preceding lactation and the pathophysiological sequelae such as increased lipolysis and ketogenesis and decreased feed intake.},

	abstract = {Prediction of postpartum hyperketonemia (HYK) using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry analysis could be a practical diagnostic option for farms because these data are now available from routine milk analysis during Dairy Herd Improvement testing. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop and evaluate blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) prediction models using multivariate linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLS), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods and (2) evaluate whether milk FTIR spectrum (mFTIR)–based models are improved with the inclusion of test-day variables (mTest; milk composition and producer-reported data). Paired blood and milk samples were collected from multiparous cows 5 to 18 d postpartum at 3 Wisconsin farms (3,629 observations from 1,013 cows). Blood BHB concentration was determined by a Precision Xtra meter (Abbot Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA), and milk samples were analyzed by a privately owned laboratory (AgSource, Menomonie, WI) for components and FTIR spectrum absorbance. Producer-recorded variables were extracted from farm management software. A blood BHB ≥1.2 mmol/L was considered HYK. The data set was divided into a training set (n = 3,020) and an external testing set (n = 609). Model fitting was implemented with JMP 12 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training data set for the MLR, PLS, and ANN prediction methods, with square root of blood BHB as the dependent variable. Each method was fitted using 3 combinations of variables: mFTIR, mTest, or mTest + mFTIR variables. Models were evaluated based on coefficient of determination, root mean squared error, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Four models (PLS–mTest + mFTIR, ANN–mFTIR, ANN–mTest, and ANN–mTest + mFTIR) were chosen for further evaluation in the testing set after fitting to the full training set. In the cross-validation analysis, model fit was greatest for ANN, followed by PLS and MLR. Diagnostic strength after cross-validation was poorest for MLR and was similar for ANN and PLS. Models that used mTest + mFTIR variables performed marginally better than models that used only mFTIR or mTest variables. These results suggest that blood BHB prediction models that use mFTIR + mTest variables may be useful additions to existing HYK diagnostic and management programs.},

	abstract = {Body condition scoring (BCS) is a farm-management tool for estimating dairy cows’ energy reserves. Today, BCS is performed manually by experts. This paper presents a 3-dimensional algorithm that provides a topographical understanding of the cow’s body to estimate BCS. An automatic BCS system consisting of a Kinect camera (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) triggered by a passive infrared motion detector was designed and implemented. Image processing and regression algorithms were developed and included the following steps: (1) image restoration, the removal of noise; (2) object recognition and separation, identification and separation of the cows; (3) movie and image selection, selection of movies and frames that include the relevant data; (4) image rotation, alignment of the cow parallel to the x-axis; and (5) image cropping and normalization, removal of irrelevant data, setting the image size to 150×200 pixels, and normalizing image values. All steps were performed automatically, including image selection and classification. Fourteen individual features per cow, derived from the cows’ topography, were automatically extracted from the movies and from the farm’s herd-management records. These features appear to be measurable in a commercial farm. Manual BCS was performed by a trained expert and compared with the output of the training set. A regression model was developed, correlating the features with the manual BCS references. Data were acquired for 4 d, resulting in a database of 422 movies of 101 cows. Movies containing cows’ back ends were automatically selected (389 movies). The data were divided into a training set of 81 cows and a test set of 20 cows; both sets included the identical full range of BCS classes. Accuracy tests gave a mean absolute error of 0.26, median absolute error of 0.19, and coefficient of determination of 0.75, with 100\% correct classification within 1 step and 91\% correct classification within a half step for BCS classes. Results indicated good repeatability, with all standard deviations under 0.33. The algorithm is independent of the background and requires 10 cows for training with approximately 30 movies of 4 s each.},

	abstract = {Fatty acid composition in milk is not only reflective of nutritional quality but also potentially predictive of other attributes (e. g. including the cow's energy balance and its relative output of methane emissions). Furthermore, a higher ratio of long-chain to short-chain fatty acids or mean carbon number has been associated with negative energy balance in dairy cows, whereas enhanced nutritional properties have been generally associated with higher levels of unsaturation. We set out to directly compare Bayesian regression strategies with partial least squares for the prediction of various milk fatty acids using Fourier-transform infrared spectrum data on 777 milk samples taken from 579 cows on 4 Michigan dairy herds between 5 and 90 d in milk. We also set out to identify those spectral regions that might be associated with fatty acids and whether carbon number or level of unsaturation might contribute to the strength of these associations. These associations were based on adaptively clustered windows of wavenumbers to mitigate the distorting effects of severe multicollinearity on marginal associations involving individual wavenumbers. In general, Bayesian regression methods, particularly the variable selection method BayesB, outperformed partial least squares regression for cross-validation prediction accuracy for both individual fatty acids and fatty acid groups. Strong signals for wavenumber associations using BayesB were well distributed throughout the mid-infrared spectrum, particularly between 910 and 3,998 cm−1. Carbon number appeared to be linearly related to strength of wavenumber associations for 38 moderately to highly predicted fatty acids within the spectral regions of 2,286 to 2,376 and 2,984 to 3,100 cm−1, whereas nonlinear associations were determined within 1,141 to 1,205; 1,570 to 1,630; and 1,727 to 1,768 cm−1. However, no such associations were detected with level of unsaturation. Spectral regions where there were significant relationships between strength of association and carbon number may be useful targets for inferring the relative proportion of long-chain to short-chain fatty acids, and hence energy balance.},

	abstract = {High-throughput phenotyping technologies are growing in importance in livestock systems due to their ability to generate real-time, non-invasive, and accurate animal-level information. Collecting such individual-level information can generate novel traits and potentially improve animal selection and management decisions in livestock operations. One of the most relevant tools used in the dairy and beef industry to predict complex traits is infrared spectrometry, which is based on the analysis of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter. The infrared electromagnetic radiation spans an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies known as the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectrum is divided into different regions, with near- and mid-infrared regions being the main spectral regions used in livestock applications. The advantage of using infrared spectrometry includes speed, non-destructive measurement, and great potential for on-line analysis. This paper aims to review the use of mid- and near-infrared spectrometry techniques as tools to predict complex dairy and beef phenotypes, such as milk composition, feed efficiency, methane emission, fertility, energy balance, health status, and meat quality traits. Although several research studies have used these technologies to predict a wide range of phenotypes, most of them are based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) and did not considered other machine learning (ML) techniques to improve prediction quality. Therefore, we will discuss the role of analytical methods employed on spectral data to improve the predictive ability for complex traits in livestock operations. Furthermore, we will discuss different approaches to reduce data dimensionality and the impact of validation strategies on predictive quality.},

	abstract = {The transition period is a demanding phase in the life of dairy cows. Metabolic and infectious disorders frequently occur in the first weeks after calving. To identify cows that are less able to cope with the transition period, physiologic or behavioral signals acquired with sensors might be useful. However, it is not yet clear which signals or combination of signals and which signal properties are most informative with respect to disease severity after calving. Sensor data on activity and behavior measurements as well as rumen and ear temperature data from 22 dairy cows were collected during a period starting 2 wk before expected parturition until 6 wk after parturition. During this period, the health status of each cow was clinically scored daily. A total deficit score (TDS) was calculated based on the clinical assessment, summarizing disease length and intensity for each cow. Different sensor data properties recorded during the period before calving as well as the period after calving were tested as a predictor for TDS using univariate analysis of covariance. To select the model with the best combination of signals and signal properties, we quantified the prediction accuracy for TDS in a multivariate model. Prediction accuracy for TDS increased when sensors were combined, using static and dynamic signal properties. Statistically, the most optimal linear combination of predictors consisted of average eating time, variance of daily ear temperature, and regularity of daily behavior patterns in the dry period. Our research indicates that a combination of static and dynamic sensor data properties could be used as indicators of cow resilience.},

	abstract = {Lameness has a considerable influence on the welfare and health of dairy cows. Many attempts have been made to develop automatic lameness detection systems using computer vision technology. However, these detection methods are easily affected by the characteristics of individual cows, resulting in inaccurate detection of lameness. Therefore, this study explores an individualized lameness detection method for dairy cattle based on the supporting phase using computer vision. This approach is applied to eliminate the influence of the characteristics of individual cows and to detect lame cows and lame hooves. In this paper, the correlation coefficient between lameness and the supporting phase is calculated, a lameness detection algorithm based on the supporting phase is proposed, and the accuracy of the algorithm is verified. Additionally, the reliability of this method using computer vision technology is verified based on deep learning. One hundred naturally walking cows are selected from video data for analysis. The results show that the correlation between lameness and the supporting phase was 0.864; 96\% of cows were correctly classified, and 93\% of lame hooves were correctly detected using the supporting phase–based lameness detection algorithm. The mean average precision is 87.0\%, and the number of frames per second is 83.3 when the Receptive Field Block Net Single Shot Detector deep learning network was used to detect the locations of cow hooves in the video. The results show that the supporting phase–based lameness detection method proposed in this paper can be used for the detection and classification of cow lameness and the detection of lame hooves with high accuracy. This approach eliminates the influence of individual cow characteristics and could be integrated into an automatic detection system and widely applied for the detection of cow lameness.},

The development of various innovative techniques aims at improving animal behaviour monitoring and thus animal welfare indicators on-farm. Automated lameness detection systems have to be valid, reliable and practicable to be applied in veterinary practice or under farm conditions. The objective of this literature review was to describe the current automated systems for detection of lameness in cattle, which have been recently developed and investigated for application in dairy research and practice. The automatic methods of lameness detection broadly fall into three categories: kinematic, kinetic and indirect methods. The performance of the methods were compared with the reference standard (locomotion score and/or lesion score) and evaluated based on level-based scheme defining the degree of development (level I, sensor technique; level II, validation of algorithm; level III, performance for detection of lameness and/or lesion; level IV, decision support with early warning system). Many scientific studies have been performed on levels I–III, but there are no studies of level IV technology. The adoption rate of automated lameness detection systems by herd managers mainly yields returns on investment by the early identification of lame cows. Long-term studies, using validated automated lameness detection systems aiming at early lameness detection, are still needed in order to improve welfare and production under field conditions.},

	abstract = {Locomotion scoring is time consuming and is not commonly completed on farms. Farmers also underestimate their herds' lameness prevalence, a knowledge gap that impedes lameness management. Automation of lameness detection could address this knowledge gap and facilitate improved lameness management. The literature pertinent to adding lameness detection to accelerometers is reviewed in this paper. Options for lameness detection systems are examined including the choice of sensor, raw data collected, variables extracted, and statistical classification methods used. Two categories of variables derived from accelerometer-based systems are examined. These categories are behavior measures such as lying and measures of gait. For example, one measure of gait is the time a leg is swinging during a gait cycle. Some behavior-focused studies have reported accuracy levels of greater than 80\%. Cow gait measures have been investigated to a lesser extent than behavior. However, classification accuracies as high as 91\% using gait measures have been reported with hardware likely to be practical for commercial farms. The need for even higher accuracy and potential barriers to adoption are discussed. Significant progress is still required to realize a system with sufficient specificity and sensitivity. Lameness detection systems using 1 accelerometer per cow and a resolution lower than 100 Hz with gait measurement functions are suggested to balance cost and data requirements. However, gait measurement using accelerometers is rather underdeveloped. Therefore, a high priority should be given to the development of novel gait measures and testing their ability to differentiate lame from nonlame cows.},

	abstract = {Newborn ungulates depend on the timely supply of colostrum containing sufficient immunoglobulins to obtain passive immunity against disease. Brix refractometry enables a rapid on-farm estimation of colostrum quality and has been intensively studied in bovines. However, the suitability of Brix refractometers for assessing colostrum quality in goats and ewes has been scarcely evaluated. The present study compared bovine, caprine, and ovine colostrum quality estimation using an optical Brix refractometer. In addition, between-species variations in the relationships between Brix values and colostrum constituents (IgG, fat, protein, and lactose) and the accuracy of Brix refractometry at different cutoff values were evaluated by a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We measured the Brix value and contents of IgG, fat, protein, and lactose in 324 colostrum samples (108 cows, 116 does, and 100 ewes). Thresholds for classification of good colostrum quality (as determined by ELISA) were set at 50 mg IgG/mL in cows and 20 mg/mL in does and ewes. Bovine colostrum showed the greatest IgG concentrations compared with caprine and ovine colostrum. Fat and protein content was higher in sheep colostrum compared with the other species, whereas the highest lactose concentrations were detected in goat colostrum. Brix values ranged from 11.4 to 34.6\% (22.1 ± 4.2\%; mean ± standard deviation), 15.4 to 40.0\% (28.5 ± 6.8\%), and 8.8 to 39.8\% (21.6 ± 5.3\%) in bovine, ovine, and caprine colostrum, respectively. In all 3 species, Brix was highly correlated with IgG and protein concentrations (cows, r = 0.83 and 0.98; goats, r = 0.83 and 0.89; sheep, r = 0.75 and 0.87). Optimal cutoff points for greatest accuracy of Brix measurements were 19.3\% Brix in cows [with 87.1\% sensitivity (Se) and 100\% specificity (Sp)], 20.7\% Brix in does (with 53.5\% Se and 100\% Sp), and 26.5\% Brix in ewes (with 75\% Se and 91.3\% Sp). In conclusion, Brix refractometry is an acceptable tool for on-farm estimations of colostrum quality in does and ewes despite distinct between-species variations in colostrum composition.},

            We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree‐based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a powerful high-throughput phenotyping tool for predicting traits that are expensive and difficult to measure in dairy cattle. Calibration equations are often developed using standard methods, such as partial least squares (PLS) regression. Methods that employ penalization, rank-reduction, and variable selection, as well as being able to model the nonlinear relations between phenotype and FTIR, might offer improvements in predictive ability and model robustness. This study aimed to compare the predictive ability of 2 machine learning methods, namely random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM), and penalized regression against PLS regression for predicting 3 phenotypes differing in terms of biological meaning and relationships with milk composition (i.e., phenotypes measurable directly and not directly in milk, reflecting different biological processes which can be captured using milk spectra) in Holstein-Friesian cattle under 2 cross-validation scenarios. The data set comprised phenotypic information from 471 Holstein-Friesian cows, and 3 target phenotypes were evaluated: (1) body condition score (BCS), (2) blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB, mmol/L), and (3) κ-casein expressed as a percentage of nitrogen (κ-CN, \% N). The data set was split considering 2 cross-validation scenarios: samples-out random in which the population was randomly split into 10-folds (8-folds for training and 1-fold for validation and testing); and herd/date-out in which the population was randomly assigned to training (70\% herd), validation (10\%), and testing (20\% herd) based on the herd and date in which the samples were collected. The random grid search was performed using the training subset for the hyperparameter optimization and the validation set was used for the generalization of prediction error. The trained model was then used to assess the final prediction in the testing subset. The grid search for penalized regression evidenced that the elastic net (EN) was the best regularization with increase in predictive ability of 5\%. The performance of PLS (standard model) was compared against 2 machine learning techniques and penalized regression using 2 cross-validation scenarios. Machine learning methods showed a greater predictive ability for BCS (0.63 for GBM and 0.61 for RF), BHB (0.80 for GBM and 0.79 for RF), and κ-CN (0.81 for GBM and 0.80 for RF) in samples-out cross-validation. Considering a herd/date-out cross-validation these values were 0.58 (GBM and RF) for BCS, 0.73 (GBM and RF) for BHB, and 0.77 (GBM and RF) for κ-CN. The GBM model tended to outperform other methods in predictive ability around 4\%, 1\%, and 7\% for EN, RF, and PLS, respectively. The prediction accuracies of the GBM and RF models were similar, and differed statistically from the PLS model in samples-out random cross-validation. Although, machine learning techniques outperformed PLS in herd/date-out cross-validation, no significant differences were observed in terms of predictive ability due to the large standard deviation observed for predictions. Overall, GBM achieved the highest accuracy of FTIR-based prediction of the different phenotypic traits across the cross-validation scenarios. These results indicate that GBM is a promising method for obtaining more accurate FTIR-based predictions for different phenotypes in dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of “grass-fed” labeled food products on the market has increased in recent years, often commanding a premium price. To date, the majority of methods used for the authentication of grass-fed source products are driven by auditing and inspection of farm records. As such, the ability to verify grass-fed source claims to ensure consumer confidence will be important in the future. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is widely used in the dairy industry as a rapid method for the routine monitoring of individual herd milk composition and quality. Further harnessing the data from individual spectra offers a promising and readily implementable strategy to authenticate the milk source at both farm and processor levels. Herein, a comprehensive comparison of the robustness, specificity, and accuracy of 11 machine-learning statistical analysis methods were tested for the discrimination of grass-fed versus non-grass-fed milks based on the MIR spectra of 4,320 milk samples collected from cows on pasture or indoor total mixed ration–based feeding systems over a 3-yr period. Linear discriminant analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were demonstrated to offer the greatest level of accuracy for the prediction of cow diet from MIR spectra. Parsimonious strategies for the selection of the most discriminating wavelengths within the spectra are also highlighted.},

	abstract = {Accurately identifying pregnancy status is imperative for a profitable dairy enterprise. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is routinely used to determine fat and protein concentrations in milk samples. Mid-infrared spectra have successfully been used to predict other economically important traits, including fatty acid content, mineral content, body energy status, lactoferrin, feed intake, and methane emissions. Machine learning has been used in a variety of fields to find patterns in vast quantities of data. This study aims to use deep learning, a sub-branch of machine learning, to establish pregnancy status from routinely collected milk MIR spectral data. Milk spectral data were obtained from National Milk Records (Chippenham, UK), who collect large volumes of data continuously on a monthly basis. Two approaches were followed: using genetic algorithms for feature selection and network design (model 1), and transfer learning with a pretrained DenseNet model (model 2). Feature selection in model 1 showed that the number of wave points in MIR data could be reduced from 1,060 to 196 wave points. The trained model converged after 162 epochs with validation accuracy and loss of 0.89 and 0.18, respectively. Although the accuracy was sufficiently high, the loss (in terms of predicting only 2 labels) was considered too high and suggested that the model would not be robust enough to apply to industry. Model 2 was trained in 2 stages of 100 epochs each with spectral data converted to gray-scale images and resulted in accuracy and loss of 0.97 and 0.08, respectively. Inspection on inference data showed prediction sensitivity of 0.89, specificity of 0.86, and prediction accuracy of 0.88. Results indicate that milk MIR data contains features relating to pregnancy status and the underlying metabolic changes in dairy cows, and such features can be identified by means of deep learning. Prediction equations from trained models can be used to alert farmers of nonviable pregnancies as well as to verify conception dates.},

	abstract = {In animal agriculture, the need to understand complex biological, environmental, and management relationships is increasing. In addition, as knowledge increases and profit margins shrink, our ability and desire to predict responses to various management decisions also increases. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to help show how improved mathematical and statistical tools and computer technology can help us gain more accurate information from published studies and improve future research. Researchers, in several recent reviews, have gathered data from multiple published studies and attempted to formulate a quantitative model that best explains the observations. In statistics, this process has been labeled meta-analysis. Generally, there are large differences between studies: e. g., different physiological status of the experimental units, different experimental design, different measurement methods, and laboratory technicians. From a statistical standpoint, studies are blocks and their effects must be considered random because the inference being sought is to future, unknown studies. Meta-analyses in the animal sciences have generally ignored the Study effect. Because data gathered across studies are unbalanced with respect to predictor variables, ignoring the Study effect has as a consequence that the estimation of parameters (slopes and intercept) of regression models can be severely biased. Additionally, variance estimates are biased upward, resulting in large type II errors when testing the effect of independent variables. Historically, the Study effect has been considered a fixed effect not because of a strong argument that such effect is indeed fixed but because of our prior inability to efficiently solve even modest-sized mixed models (those containing both fixed and random effects). Modern statistical software has, however, overcome this limitation. Consequently, meta-analyses should now incorporate the Study effect and its interaction effects as random components of a mixed model. This would result in better prediction equations of biological systems and a more accurate description of their prediction errors.},

	abstract = {Machine learning approaches have been widely used for crop yield modelling and yield forecasting but there has been limited application to understanding site-specific yield constraints. Crop yield is driven by a complex interaction of spatial and temporal variables, which makes it challenging to define the exact cause of observed spatial yield variability explicitly. This makes it difficult to design efficient management strategies to address production constraints. There is a need for a more quantitative and systematic approach to identify and understand the causes of variation in crop yield in order to implement appropriate management responses. This study investigated the use of interpretive machine learning (IML) to address this need. The developed methodology was demonstrated on furrow-irrigated cotton fields totalling ∼2000 ha in the Condamine-Balonne River catchment, Australia. Digital soil maps of important soil constraints were created at 20 m spatial resolution using 70 soil cores extracted to 1.4 m depth and a combination of on-farm and off-farm spatial data layers. Specifically, the soil constraints represented were exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP – sodicity), pH (alkalinity), and electrical conductivity (ECe – salinity). Terrain infrastructure variable maps of closed depressions, distance down furrow, and cut and fill (from landforming practices) were also developed. Empirical models of cotton lint yield were created with gradient boosted decision trees (XGBoost) using the digital soil maps and terrain infrastructure data as predictor variables. The models could describe the spatial variation in yield well, with a median Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient of 0.67 and root-mean-square error of 0.75b ha−1. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an IML approach based on game theory, was then used to identify the contribution of each variable to the modelled yield across the study area. The variable most decreasing yield at each point was identified and mapped across the study area, and the spatial extent represented by each variable quantified. The SHAP values for each predictor variable were also extracted and mapped for a case study field, which demonstrated the magnitude of the impact of each variable on yield with spatial context in easily interpretable units (b ha−1). The presented methodology is promising for cost-benefit analysis of implementing remediation strategies, or where not economically feasible, altering management inputs according to a constrained yield potential.},
